## [3.6.1] - 2021-07-15

**Note that the upcoming ElasticPress 4.0.0 release will remove built assets from the `develop` branch, will replace `master` with `trunk`, will build a stable release version including built assets into a `stable` branch, and will include a build script should you want to build assets from a branch.**  As such, please plan to update any references you have from `master` to either `stable` or `trunk` depending on whether you require built assets or not.

This version requires a full reindex. The new `facet` field introduced in `3.6.0` requires a change in the mapping, otherwise, all content sync related to posts will silently fail. If you've upgraded to 3.6.0 and didn't resync your content yet (via Dashboard or with WP-CLI `wp elasticpress index --setup`) make sure to do so.

* Filter `ep_remote_request_add_ep_user_agent`. Passing `true` to that, the ElasticPress version will be added to the User-Agent header in the request. Props [@felipeelia](https://github.com/felipeelia) via [#2264](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/pull/2264)

## [3.6.0] - 2021-07-07
**Note that the upcoming ElasticPress 4.0.0 release will remove built assets from the `develop` branch, will replace `master` with `trunk`, will build a stable release version including built assets into a `stable` branch, and will include a build script should you want to build assets from a branch.**  As such, please plan to update any references you have from `master` to either `stable` or `trunk` depending on whether you require built assets or not.

## [3.5.4] - 2021-02-11
This is primarily a security and bug fix release. PLEASE NOTE that versions 3.5.2 and 3.5.3 contain a vulnerability that allows a user to bypass the nonce check associated with re-sending the unaltered default search query to ElasticPress.io that is used for providing Autosuggest queries.

A bug fix release.

Bug fixes:
* Fixes highlighting so that full content is returned instead of only snippets.
* Fix empty synonym bug.
* Only highlight post content, excerpt, and title.

Enhancements:
* Track CLI index in a headless fashion

## [3.5.0] - 2020-10-20
Version 3.5 is a very exciting release as it contains two major new features: a synonym dashboard and search term result highlighting. The synonym dashboard empowerers users to create synonym lists for searches. For example. searching "New York City" would return contain with "NYC". Search term highlighting will underline and add a CSS class to keywords within content that matches the current search.

The new version also includes a revamp of the search algorithm. This is a backwards compatibility break. If you'd like to revert to the old search algorithm, you can use the following code: `add_filter( 'ep_search_algorithm_version', function() { return '3.4'; } );`. The new algorithm offers much more relevant search results and removes fuzziness which results in mostly unwanted results for most people. If you are hooking in and modifying the search query directly, it's possible this code might break and you might need to tweak it.

## [3.0] - 2019-05-13
### Notice
- Requires re-index

### Overview
- 3.0 is a refactor of ElasticPress for modern coding standards (PHP 5.4 required) as well as the introduction to indexables. Indexables abstracts out content types so data types other than post can be indexed and searched. 3.0 includes user indexing and search (integration with WP_User_Query). User features require at least WordPress version 5.1.
- The refactor changes a lot of ElasticPress internals. The biggest change is the feature registration API has completely changed. Now, new features should extend the `ElasticPress\Feature` class rather than calling `ep_register_feature`. Older features should be backwards compatible.

### Added
- Elasticsearch language setting in admin

### Changed
- `ep_post_sync_kill` filter removed `$post_args` argument.
- `posts-per-page` changed to `per-page` for WP-CLI index command.

### Removed

## [2.5.2] - 2018-05-09
### Notice
- Requires re-index

### Removed
- Unnecessary facet JavaScript

### Fixed
- Facet aggregations warning

## [2.5.1] - 2018-05-02
### Notice
- Requires re-index as we change the way data is being sent to Elasticsearch.
- It's also worth noting for ElasticPress version 2.5+, the Facets feature, which is on by default, will run post type archive and search page main queries through Elasticsearch. If Elasticsearch is out of sync with your content (possible in rare edge cases), this could result in incorrect content being shown. Turning off Facets would fix the problem.

### Fixed
- Don't pre-strip HTML before sending it to Elasticsearch.
- Support PHP 5.2 backwards compat.
- Don't show faceting widget if post type doesn't support taxonomy.

## [2.5] - 2018-04-23
### Overview
- ElasticPress 2.5 includes a new Facets feature that makes it easy to add high performance content filtering controls to a website.
- A new Facets widget enables site administrators to add taxonomy facets to a sidebar (or any widgetized area). When viewing a content list on the front end of the website, the widget will display the name of the taxonomy – e.g. “Categories” – and a checklist with all of its terms. Visitors can narrow down content by selecting terms they are interested in. The Facets feature can be globally configured to narrow results to content that is tagged with any or all of the selected terms. The widget’s front end output contains carefully named CSS classes, so that designers and developers can apply unique styling.

### Added
- Official support for Elasticsearch 6.2
- Increased functional parity with the WP_Query API
- Facets feature
- `--post-ids` CLI option to index only specific posts. Props [@dotancohen](https://github.com/dotancohen).

- Taxonomy sync object warning. Props [@eugene-manuilov](https://github.com/eugene-manuilov)
- `true` in `is_empty_query` terminates ep_query process when it shouldn't. Props [@yaronuliel](https://github.com/yaronuliel)

## [2.4.2] - 2018-01-31
### Fixed

## [2.4] - 2017-11-01
### Overview
- Version 2.4 introduces the Autosuggest feature. When enabled, input fields of type "search" or with the CSS class "search-field" or "ep-autosuggest" will be enhanced with autosuggest functionality. As text is entered into the search field, suggested content will appear below it, based on top search results for the text. Suggestions link directly to the content.
- We also added hooks and filters to ElasticPress that make query logging possible. The [Debug Bar ElasticPress](https://github.com/10up/debug-bar-elasticpress) plugin now adds a Query Log screen to the ElasticPress admin menu. The Query Log is an extremely powerful tool for diagnosing search and indexing issues.

### Added
- Autosuggest feature

## [2.3.1] - 2017-06-29
### Notice
- This requires a re-index if you are using the WooCommerce feature.

### Fixed
- Properly respect WC product visibility. Props [@ivankristianto](https://github.com/ivankristianto).

## [2.3] - 2017-05-26

- Prevent EP from auto-activating a feature that was force deactivated
- Prevent massive field Elasticsearch error when indexing large strings

## [2.2] - 2017-02-28
### Notice
- Requires re-index

### Overview
- Version 2.2 rethinks the module process to make ElasticPress a more complete query engine solution. Modules are now auto-on and really just features. Why would anyone want to not use amazing functionality that improves speed and relevancy on their website? Features (previously modules) can of course be overridden and disabled. Features that don't have their minimum requirements met, such as a missing plugin dependency, are auto-disabled.
- We've bumped the minimum Elasticsearch version to 1.7 (although we strongly recommend 2+). The maximum tested version of Elasticsearch is version 5.2. If you are running Elasticsearch outside this version range, you will see a warning in the dashboard.

### Added

### Added
- Filter around the search fuzziness argument. Props [@dkotter](https://github.com/dkotter).
- Make post indexing a non-blocking query. Props [@cmmarslender](https://github.com/cmmarslender).

## [1.7] (Mapping change, requires reindex) - 2015-12-11
### Overview
- ElasticPress 1.7 restructures meta mapping for posts for much more flexible meta queries. The `post_meta` Elasticsearch post property has been left for backwards compatibility. As of this version, post meta will be stored in the `meta` Elasticsearch property. `meta` is structured as follows:
- When querying posts, you will get back `meta.value`. However, if you plan to mess with the new post mapping, it's important to understand the intricacies.
- The real implications of this is in `meta_query`. You can now effectively search by meta types. See the new section in README.md for details on this.

### Added
- `meta.value` (string)
- `meta.raw` (unanalyzed string)
- `meta.long` (unanalyzed number)
- `meta.double` (unanalyzed number)
- `meta.boolean` (unanalyzed number)
- `meta.date` (unanalyzed yyyy-MM-dd date)

- `time` (unanalyzed HH:mm:ss time)
- Index posts according to post type. Props [@sc0ttkclark](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark)

### Fixed
- Prevent missed post indexing when duplicate post dates. Props [@lukaspawlik](https://github.com/lukaspawlik)
- Complex meta types are automatically serialized upon storage.
