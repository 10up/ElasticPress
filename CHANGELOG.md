# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, per [the Keep a Changelog standard](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [3.5.1]

A bug fix release.

Bug fixes:
* Fixes highlighting so that full content is returned instead of only snippets.
* Fix empty synonym bug.
* Only highlight post content, excerpt, and title.

Enhancements:
* Track CLI index in a headless fashion

## [3.5.0]

Version 3.5 is a very exciting release as it contains two major new features: a synonym dashboard and search term result highlighting. The synonym dashboard empowerers users to create synonym lists for searches. For example. searching "New York City" would return contain with "NYC". Search term highlighting will underline and add a CSS class to keywords within content that matches the current search.

The new version also includes a revamp of the search algorithm. This is a backwards compatibility break. If you'd like to revert to the old search algorithm, you can use the following code: `add_filter( 'ep_search_algorithm_version', function() { return '3.4'; } );`. The new algorithm offers much more relevant search results and removes fuzziness which results in mostly unwanted results for most people. If you are hooking in and modifying the search query directly, it's possible this code might break and you might need to tweak it.

## [3.0] - 2019-05-13
### Notice
- Requires re-index

### Overview
- 3.0 is a refactor of ElasticPress for modern coding standards (PHP 5.4 required) as well as the introduction to indexables. Indexables abstracts out content types so data types other than post can be indexed and searched. 3.0 includes user indexing and search (integration with WP_User_Query). User features require at least WordPress version 5.1.
- The refactor changes a lot of ElasticPress internals. The biggest change is the feature registration API has completely changed. Now, new features should extend the `ElasticPress\Feature` class rather than calling `ep_register_feature`. Older features should be backwards compatible.

### Added
- Elasticsearch language setting in admin

### Changed
- `ep_post_sync_kill` filter removed `$post_args` argument.
- `posts-per-page` changed to `per-page` for WP-CLI index command.

### Removed

## [2.8.0] - 2019-02-08
### Added
- Sticky posts support.
- WooCommerce searches with custom fields.
- Elasticsearch version in settings. (Props [@turtlepod](https://github.com/turtlepod))
- Allow user to set number of posts during bulk indexing cycle.

### Changed

## [2.5.2] - 2018-05-09
### Notice
- Requires re-index

### Removed
- Unnecessary facet JavaScript

### Fixed
- Facet aggregations warning

## [2.5.1] - 2018-05-02
### Notice
- Requires re-index as we change the way data is being sent to Elasticsearch.
- It's also worth noting for ElasticPress version 2.5+, the Facets feature, which is on by default, will run post type archive and search page main queries through Elasticsearch. If Elasticsearch is out of sync with your content (possible in rare edge cases), this could result in incorrect content being shown. Turning off Facets would fix the problem.

### Fixed
- Don't pre-strip HTML before sending it to Elasticsearch.
- Support PHP 5.2 backwards compat.
- Don't show faceting widget if post type doesn't support taxonomy.

## [2.5] - 2018-04-23
### Overview
- ElasticPress 2.5 includes a new Facets feature that makes it easy to add high performance content filtering controls to a website.
- A new Facets widget enables site administrators to add taxonomy facets to a sidebar (or any widgetized area). When viewing a content list on the front end of the website, the widget will display the name of the taxonomy – e.g. “Categories” – and a checklist with all of its terms. Visitors can narrow down content by selecting terms they are interested in. The Facets feature can be globally configured to narrow results to content that is tagged with any or all of the selected terms. The widget’s front end output contains carefully named CSS classes, so that designers and developers can apply unique styling.

### Added
- Official support for Elasticsearch 6.2

### Fixed

- Taxonomy sync object warning. Props [@eugene-manuilov](https://github.com/eugene-manuilov)
- `true` in `is_empty_query` terminates ep_query process when it shouldn't. Props [@yaronuliel](https://github.com/yaronuliel)

## [2.4.2] - 2018-01-31
### Fixed

## [2.4.1] - 2018-01-30

## [2.4] - 2017-11-01
### Overview
- Version 2.4 introduces the Autosuggest feature. When enabled, input fields of type "search" or with the CSS class "search-field" or "ep-autosuggest" will be enhanced with autosuggest functionality. As text is entered into the search field, suggested content will appear below it, based on top search results for the text. Suggestions link directly to the content.
- We also added hooks and filters to ElasticPress that make query logging possible. The [Debug Bar ElasticPress](https://github.com/10up/debug-bar-elasticpress) plugin now adds a Query Log screen to the ElasticPress admin menu. The Query Log is an extremely powerful tool for diagnosing search and indexing issues.

### Added

## [2.3.1] - 2017-06-29
### Notice
- This requires a re-index if you are using the WooCommerce feature.

### Fixed

## [2.2] - 2017-02-28
### Notice
- Requires re-index

### Overview
- Version 2.2 rethinks the module process to make ElasticPress a more complete query engine solution. Modules are now auto-on and really just features. Why would anyone want to not use amazing functionality that improves speed and relevancy on their website? Features (previously modules) can of course be overridden and disabled. Features that don't have their minimum requirements met, such as a missing plugin dependency, are auto-disabled.
- We've bumped the minimum Elasticsearch version to 1.7 (although we strongly recommend 2+). The maximum tested version of Elasticsearch is version 5.2. If you are running Elasticsearch outside this version range, you will see a warning in the dashboard.

### Added

## [1.8] (Mapping change, requires reindex) - 2016-01-19
### Overview
- ElasticPress 1.8 adds a bunch of mapping changes for accomplishing more complex WP_Query functions such as filtering by term id and sorting by any Elasticsearch property. Version 1.8 also speeds up post syncing dramatically through non-blocking queries. Full list of enhancements and bug fixes:

### Added
- Filter around the search fuzziness argument. Props [@dkotter](https://github.com/dkotter).
- Make post indexing a non-blocking query. Props [@cmmarslender](https://github.com/cmmarslender).
- Log queries for debugging. Makes [ElasticPress Debug Bar](https://github.com/10up/debug-bar-elasticpress) plugin possible.
- Make `posts_per_page = -1` possible.
- Support term id and name tax queries.
- raw/sortable to property to term mapping. Props [@sc0ttkclark](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark)
- raw/sortable property to meta mapping. Props [@sc0ttkclark](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark)

- Support arbitrary document paths in orderby. Props [@sc0ttkclark](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark).

## [1.7] (Mapping change, requires reindex) - 2015-12-11
### Overview
- ElasticPress 1.7 restructures meta mapping for posts for much more flexible meta queries. The `post_meta` Elasticsearch post property has been left for backwards compatibility. As of this version, post meta will be stored in the `meta` Elasticsearch property. `meta` is structured as follows:
- When querying posts, you will get back `meta.value`. However, if you plan to mess with the new post mapping, it's important to understand the intricacies.
- The real implications of this is in `meta_query`. You can now effectively search by meta types. See the new section in README.md for details on this.

### Added
- `meta.value` (string)
- `meta.raw` (unanalyzed string)
- `meta.long` (unanalyzed number)
- `meta.double` (unanalyzed number)
- `meta.boolean` (unanalyzed number)
- `meta.date` (unanalyzed yyyy-MM-dd date)
- `meta.datetime` (unanalyzed yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss datetime)
- `time` (unanalyzed HH:mm:ss time)
- Index posts according to post type. Props [@sc0ttkclark](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark)

### Fixed
- Prevent missed post indexing when duplicate post dates. Props [@lukaspawlik](https://github.com/lukaspawlik)
- Complex meta types are automatically serialized upon storage.
