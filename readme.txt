A fast and flexible search and query engine for WordPress.

== Description ==
ElasticPress, a fast and flexible search and query engine for WordPress, enables WordPress to find or “query” relevant content extremely fast through a variety of highly customizable features. WordPress out-of-the-box struggles to analyze content relevancy and can be very slow. ElasticPress supercharges your WordPress website making for happier users and administrators. The plugin even contains features for popular plugins.

Here is a list of the amazing ElasticPress features included in the plugin:

__Search__: Instantly find the content you’re looking for. The first time.

__WooCommerce__: “I want a cotton, woman’s t-shirt, for under $15 that’s in stock.” Faceted product browsing strains servers and increases load times. Your buyers can find the perfect product quickly, and buy it quickly.

__Related Posts__: ElasticPress understands data in real time, so it can instantly deliver engaging and precise related content with no impact on site performance.

__Protected Content__: Optionally index all of your content, including private and unpublished content, to speed up searches and queries in places like the administrative dashboard.

__Documents__: Indexes text inside of popular file types, and adds those files types to search results.

__Autosuggest__: Suggest relevant content as text is entered into the search field.

__Facets__: Add controls to your website to filter content by one or more taxonomies.

__Users__: Improve user search relevancy and query performance.

Please refer to [Github](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress) for detailed usage instructions and documentation.

== Installation ==
1. First, you will need to properly [install and configure](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html) Elasticsearch.
2. Activate the plugin in WordPress.
3. In the ElasticPress settings page, input your Elasticsearch host.
4. Sync your content by clicking the sync icon.
5. Enjoy!

== Changelog ==

= 3.0 (Requires re-index) =

3.0 is a refactor of ElasticPress for modern coding standards (PHP 5.4 required) as well as the introduction to indexables. Indexables abstracts out content types so data types other than post can be indexed and searched. 3.0 includes user indexing and search (integration with WP_User_Query). User features require at least WordPress version 5.1.

The refactor changes a lot of ElasticPress internals. The biggest change is the feature registration API has completely changed. Now, new features should extend the `ElasticPress\Feature` class rather than calling `ep_register_feature`. Older features should be backwards compatible.

Other Features:
* Elasticsearch language setting in admin

Here are a list of filters/actions removed or changed:

### Actions Removed:

* `ep_feature_setup`

### Filters changed:

* `ep_post_sync_kill` - Removed `$post_args` argument.

### Other changes:

* `posts-per-page` changed to `per-page` for WP-CLI index command.

= 2.5.2 (Requires re-index) =

This is a small bug fix release.

* Removed unnecessary facet JavaScript
* Fix facet aggregations warning

= 2.5.1 (Requires re-index) =

This if a bug fix release. This version requires a re-index as we change the way data is being sent to Elasticsearch.

It's also worth noting for ElasticPress version 2.5+, the Facets feature, which is on by default, will run post type archive and search page main queries through Elasticsearch. If Elasticsearch is out of sync with your content (possible in rare edge cases), this could result in incorrect content being shown. Turning off Facets would fix the problem.

### Bug Fixes

* Don't pre-strip HTML before sending it to Elasticsearch.
* Support PHP 5.2 backwards compat.
* Don't show faceting widget if post type doesn't support taxonomy.

= 2.5 =

ElasticPress 2.5 includes a new Facets feature that makes it easy to add high performance content filtering controls to a website.

A new Facets widget enables site administrators to add taxonomy facets to a sidebar (or any widgetized area). When viewing a content list on the front end of the website, the widget will display the name of the taxonomy – e.g. “Categories” – and a checklist with all of its terms. Visitors can narrow down content by selecting terms they are interested in. The Facets feature can be globally configured to narrow results to content that is tagged with any or all of the selected terms. The widget’s front end output contains carefully named CSS classes, so that designers and developers can apply unique styling.

Version 2.5 also includes a number of smaller enhancements and fixes, including official support for Elasticsearch 6.2, and increased functional parity with the WP_Query API.

Here is a detailed list of what's been included in the release:

### Enhancements
* Facets feature
* `--post-ids` CLI option to index only specific posts. Props [dotancohen](https://github.com/dotancohen).
* Filter for hiding host setting in dashboard. Props [tomdxw](https://github.com/tomdxw).
* Support `WP_Query` meta query `not between` comparator.

### Bugs
* Disallow duplicated Elasticsearch requests on WooCommerce orders page. Props [lukaspawlik](https://github.com/lukaspawlik)
* Fix taxonomy sync object warning. Props [eugene-manuilov](https://github.com/eugene-manuilov)
* `true` in `is_empty_query` terminates ep_query process when it shouldn't. Props [yaronuliel](https://github.com/yaronuliel)

= 2.4.2 =
Version 2.4.2 is a bug fix version.

* Fix related posts not showing up bug.

= 2.4.1 =

Version 2.4.1 is a bug fix and maintenance release. Here are a listed of issues that have been resolved:

= 2.4 =

Version 2.4 introduces the Autosuggest feature. When enabled, input fields of type "search" or with the CSS class "search-field" or "ep-autosuggest" will be enhanced with autosuggest functionality. As text is entered into the search field, suggested content will appear below it, based on top search results for the text. Suggestions link directly to the content.

We also added hooks and filters to ElasticPress that make query logging possible. The [Debug Bar ElasticPress](https://github.com/10up/debug-bar-elasticpress) plugin now adds a Query Log screen to the ElasticPress admin menu. The Query Log is an extremely powerful tool for diagnosing search and indexing issues.

Here is a comphrensive list of changes:

* Fix broken upgrade sync notification.
* Properly respect WC product visibility. Props [ivankristianto](https://github.com/ivankristianto). This requires a re-index if you are using the WooCommerce feature.

= 2.2 (Requires re-index) =

Version 2.2 rethinks the module process to make ElasticPress a more complete query engine solution. Modules are now auto-on and really just features. Why would anyone want to not use amazing functionality that improves speed and relevancy on their website? Features (previously modules) can of course be overridden and disabled. Features that don't have their minimum requirements met, such as a missing plugin dependency, are auto-disabled.

We've bumped the minimum Elasticsearch version to 1.7 (although we strongly recommend 2+). The maximum tested version of Elasticsearch is version 5.2. If you are running Elasticsearch outside this version range, you will see a warning in the dashboard.

### Enhancements

* __(Breaking change)__ Module registration API changed. See `register_module` in `classes/class-ep-modules.php`.
* __(Breaking change)__ Related posts are now in a widget instead of automatically being appending to content.
* __(Breaking change)__ Admin module renamed to Protected Content.
* Admin warning if current Elasticsearch version is not between the min/max supported version. Version 2.2 supports versions 1.3 - 5.1.
* Auto-reindex on versions requiring reindex.
* User friendly admin notifications for ElasticPress not set up, first sync needed, and feature auto activation.
* Protected Content feature applies to all features. This means if Protected Content isn't active, search or WooCommerce integration won't happen in the admin.
* Add support for post_mime_type. Props [Ritesh-patel](https://github.com/Ritesh-patel)

### Bug Fixes

* Back compat with old `ep_search` function.

10up ships ElasticPress 2.0 with __radical search algorithm improvements__ and a __more comprehensive integration of WP_Query__. ElasticPress is now even closer to supporting the complete WP_Query API. This version also improves upon post syncing ensuring that post meta updates are synced to Elasticsearch, adds a number of important hooks, and, of course, fixes some pesky bugs.

= 1.8 (Mapping change, requires reindex) =

ElasticPress 1.8 adds a bunch of mapping changes for accomplishing more complex WP_Query functions such as filtering by term id and sorting by any Elasticsearch property. Version 1.8 also speeds up post syncing dramatically through non-blocking queries. Full list of enhancements and bug fixes:

### Enhancements:

* Add a filter around the search fuzziness argument. Props [dkotter](https://github.com/dkotter).
* Make post indexing a non-blocking query. Props [cmmarslender](https://github.com/cmmarslender).

= 1.7 (Mapping change, requires reindex) =

ElasticPress 1.7 restructures meta mapping for posts for much more flexible meta queries. The `post_meta` Elasticsearch post property has been left for backwards compatibility. As of this version, post meta will be stored in the `meta` Elasticsearch property. `meta` is structured as follows:

* `meta.value` (string)
* `meta.raw` (unanalyzed string)
* `meta.long` (unanalyzed number)
* `meta.double` (unanalyzed number)
* `meta.boolean` (unanalyzed number)
* `meta.date` (unanalyzed yyyy-MM-dd date)
* `meta.datetime` (unanalyzed yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss datetime)
* `time` (unanalyzed HH:mm:ss time)

When querying posts, you will get back `meta.value`. However, if you plan to mess with the new post mapping, it's important to understand the intricacies.

The real implications of this is in `meta_query`. You can now effectively search by meta types. See the new section in README.md for details on this.

1.7 also contains the following bugs/enhancements:

* (Bug) Prevent missed post indexing when duplicate post dates. Props [lukaspawlik](https://github.com/lukaspawlik)
* (Bug) Complex meta types are automatically serialized upon storage.
* (Enhancement) Index posts according to post type. Props [sc0ttkclark](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark)
