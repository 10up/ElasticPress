A fast and flexible search and query engine for WordPress.

== Description ==
ElasticPress, a fast and flexible search and query engine for WordPress, enables WordPress to find or “query” relevant content extremely fast through a variety of highly customizable features. WordPress out-of-the-box struggles to analyze content relevancy and can be very slow. ElasticPress supercharges your WordPress website making for happier users and administrators. The plugin even contains features for popular plugins.

Here is a list of the amazing ElasticPress features included in the plugin:

__Search__: Instantly find the content you’re looking for. The first time.

__Instant Results__: A built for WordPress search experience that bypasses WordPress for optimal performance. Instant Results routes search queries through a dedicated API, separate from WordPress, returning results up to 10x faster than previous versions of ElasticPress.

__WooCommerce__: With ElasticPress, filtering WooCommerce product results is fast and easy. Your customers can find and buy exactly what they're looking for, even if you have a large or complex product catalog.

__Related Posts__: ElasticPress understands data in real time, so it can instantly deliver engaging and precise related content with no impact on site performance.

__Protected Content__: Optionally index all of your content, including private and unpublished content, to speed up searches and queries in places like the administrative dashboard.

__Documents__: Indexes text inside of popular file types, and adds those files types to search results.

__Autosuggest__: Suggest relevant content as text is entered into the search field.

__Filters__: Add controls to your website to filter content by one or more taxonomies.

__Users__: Improve user search relevancy and query performance.

__Comments__: Indexes your comments and provides a widget with type-ahead search functionality. It works with WooCommerce product reviews out-of-the-box.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does ElasticPress work? =

The ElasticPress plugin enables you to connect your WordPress site to the ElasticPress.io service, a SaaS solution that provides an enhanced search experience while reducing load on your WordPress site. For advanced users familiar with both WordPress and Elasticsearch hosting and management, ElasticPress also offers support for plugin functionality using an Elasticsearch instance. Please keep in mind that there are multiple security, performance, and configuration considerations to take into account if you take this approach.

= I have to use an in-house or custom Elasticsearch solution due to policy or institutional requirements. Can you still help? =

If circumstances prevent the use of a SaaS solution like ElasticPress.io, we can also provide [consulting](https://www.elasticpress.io/elasticpress-consulting/) around installation and configuration of custom Elasticsearch instances.

= Where can I find ElasticPress documentation and user guides? =

Please refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress) for detailed usage instructions and documentation. FAQs and tutorials can be also found on our [support site](https://elasticpress.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

= I have a problem with the plugin. Where can I get help? =

If you have identified a bug or would like to suggest an enhancement, please refer to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress). We do not provide support here at WordPress.org forums.

If you are an ElasticPress.io customer, please open a ticket in your account dashboard. If you need a custom solution, we also offer [consulting](https://www.elasticpress.io/elasticpress-consulting/).

= Where do I report security bugs? =

You can report any security bugs found in the source code of ElasticPress through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/elasticpress). The Patchstack team will assist you with verification, CVE assignment and take care of notifying the developers of this plugin.

= Is ElasticPress compatible with OpenSearch or Elasticsearch X.Y? =

ElasticPress requirements can be found in the [Requirements section](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress#requirements) of our GitHub repository. If your solution relies on a different server or version, you may find additional information on our [Compatibility documentation page](https://10up.github.io/ElasticPress/tutorial-compatibility.html).

= I really like ElasticPress! Can I contribute? =

For sure! Feel free to submit ideas or feedback in general to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress). If you can, also consider sending us [a review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/elasticpress/reviews/#new-post).

= 4.3.0 - 2022-08-31 =

ElasticPress 4.3.0 fixes some bugs and introduces some new and exciting changes.

WooCommerce Product Variations SKUs are now a publicly searchable field. Site administrators wanting to allow users to search for their product variations SKUs can enable it in the _Search Fields & Weighting_ Dashboard, under Products. If a user searches for a variation SKU, the parent product will be displayed in the search results.

The last ElasticPress sync information is now available in WordPress's Site Health. If you want to check information like the date of the last full sync, time spent, number of indexed content, or errors go to Tools -> Site Health, open the Info tab and click on _ElasticPress - Last Sync_.

Facets received some further improvements in this version. In addition to some refactoring related to WordPress Block Editor, ElasticPress 4.3.0 ships with an experimental version of a _Facet By Meta_ block. With that, users will be able to filter content based on post meta fields. If you want to try it, download and activate [this plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/10up/ElasticPress/develop/tests/cypress/wordpress-files/test-plugins/elasticpress-facet-by-meta.php). Do you have an idea of an enhancement? Search in our [`facets`](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/labels/module%3Afacets) label in GitHub and if it is not there yet, feel free to open a new issue. We would love to hear new ideas!

= 4.2.0 - 2022-05-26 =

ElasticPress 4.2.0 fixes some bugs and introduces some new and exciting changes.

The sync functionality had its JavaScript refactored. Timeouts, memory limits, and general errors are now properly handled and do not make the sync get stuck when performed via the WP-CLI `index` command. There is also a new `get-last-sync` WP-CLI command to check the errors and numbers from the last sync.

We've improved the admin search experience for sites using both WooCommerce and Protected Content. Previously, WooCommerce was processing that screen with two different queries, and EP was used only in one of them. Now, it will be only one query, fully handled by ElasticPress. Users wanting to keep the previous behavior can do so by adding `add_filter( 'ep_woocommerce_integrate_admin_products_list', '__return_false' );` to their website's codebase.

Facets are now available through a WordPress block. If you are using the Full Site Editing feature, you can now add ElasticPress Facets to your theme with just a few clicks! This block has been introduced with a simplified user interface to enable compatibility with Full Site Editing and will continue to be iterated and improved in future versions of the plugin.

__Added:__

* This version requires a full reindex.
* It introduces a new search algorithm that may change the search results displayed on your site.
* A new feature called "Instant Results" is available. As it requires a full reindex, if you plan to use it, we recommend you enable it first and reindex only once.
* Users upgrading from Beta 1 need to re-save the Instant Results feature settings.
* New minimum versions are:

	||Min|Max|
	|---|:---:|:---:|
	|Elasticsearch|5.2|7.10|
	|WordPress|5.6+|latest|
	|PHP|7.0+|latest|

**Note that ElasticPress 4.0.0 release removes built assets from the `develop` branch, replaced `master` with `trunk`, added a ZIP with the plugin and its built assets in the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/releases), and included a build script should you want to build assets from a branch.**  As such, please plan to update any references you have from `master` to `trunk` or to GitHub Releases depending on whether you require built assets or not. (See changes in [#2622](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/pull/2622).)

A bug fix release.

__Bug fixes:__

* Fix empty synonym bug.
* Only highlight post content, excerpt, and title.

__Enhancements:__

* Track CLI index in a headless fashion

= 3.5.0 - 2020-10-20 =
Version 3.5 is a very exciting release as it contains two major new features: a synonym dashboard and search term result highlighting. The synonym dashboard empowerers users to create synonym lists for searches. For example. searching "New York City" would return contain with "NYC". Search term highlighting will underline and add a CSS class to keywords within content that matches the current search.

The new version also includes a revamp of the search algorithm. This is a backwards compatibility break. If you'd like to revert to the old search algorithm, you can use the following code: `add_filter( 'ep_search_algorithm_version', function() { return '3.4'; } );`. The new algorithm offers much more relevant search results and removes fuzziness which results in mostly unwanted results for most people. If you are hooking in and modifying the search query directly, it's possible this code might break and you might need to tweak it.

= 3.0 - 2019-05-13 =
NOTICE: Requires re-index.

3.0 is a refactor of ElasticPress for modern coding standards (PHP 5.4 required) as well as the introduction to indexables. Indexables abstracts out content types so data types other than post can be indexed and searched. 3.0 includes user indexing and search (integration with WP_User_Query). User features require at least WordPress version 5.1.

The refactor changes a lot of ElasticPress internals. The biggest change is the feature registration API has completely changed. Now, new features should extend the `ElasticPress\Feature` class rather than calling `ep_register_feature`. Older features should be backwards compatible.

Other Features:
* Elasticsearch language setting in admin

Here are a list of filters/actions removed or changed:

### Actions Removed:

* `ep_feature_setup`

### Filters changed:

* `ep_post_sync_kill` - Removed `$post_args` argument.

### Other changes:

* `posts-per-page` changed to `per-page` for WP-CLI index command.

NOTICE: Requires re-index.

This is a small bug fix release.

* Removed unnecessary facet JavaScript
* Fix facet aggregations warning

= 2.5.1 - 2018-05-02 =
NOTICE: Requires re-index.

This if a bug fix release. This version requires a re-index as we change the way data is being sent to Elasticsearch.

It's also worth noting for ElasticPress version 2.5+, the Facets feature, which is on by default, will run post type archive and search page main queries through Elasticsearch. If Elasticsearch is out of sync with your content (possible in rare edge cases), this could result in incorrect content being shown. Turning off Facets would fix the problem.

### Bug Fixes

* Don't pre-strip HTML before sending it to Elasticsearch.
* Support PHP 5.2 backwards compat.
* Don't show faceting widget if post type doesn't support taxonomy.

= 2.5 - 2018-04-23 =
ElasticPress 2.5 includes a new Facets feature that makes it easy to add high performance content filtering controls to a website.

A new Facets widget enables site administrators to add taxonomy facets to a sidebar (or any widgetized area). When viewing a content list on the front end of the website, the widget will display the name of the taxonomy – e.g. “Categories” – and a checklist with all of its terms. Visitors can narrow down content by selecting terms they are interested in. The Facets feature can be globally configured to narrow results to content that is tagged with any or all of the selected terms. The widget’s front end output contains carefully named CSS classes, so that designers and developers can apply unique styling.

Version 2.5 also includes a number of smaller enhancements and fixes, including official support for Elasticsearch 6.2, and increased functional parity with the WP_Query API.

Here is a detailed list of what's been included in the release:

### Enhancements
* Facets feature
* `--post-ids` CLI option to index only specific posts. Props [dotancohen](https://github.com/dotancohen).
* Filter for hiding host setting in dashboard. Props [tomdxw](https://github.com/tomdxw).
* Support `WP_Query` meta query `not between` comparator.

### Bugs
* Disallow duplicated Elasticsearch requests on WooCommerce orders page. Props [lukaspawlik](https://github.com/lukaspawlik)
* Fix taxonomy sync object warning. Props [eugene-manuilov](https://github.com/eugene-manuilov)

= 2.4 - 2017-11-01 =
Version 2.4 introduces the Autosuggest feature. When enabled, input fields of type "search" or with the CSS class "search-field" or "ep-autosuggest" will be enhanced with autosuggest functionality. As text is entered into the search field, suggested content will appear below it, based on top search results for the text. Suggestions link directly to the content.

We also added hooks and filters to ElasticPress that make query logging possible. The [Debug Bar ElasticPress](https://github.com/10up/debug-bar-elasticpress) plugin now adds a Query Log screen to the ElasticPress admin menu. The Query Log is an extremely powerful tool for diagnosing search and indexing issues.

Here is a comphrensive list of changes:

### Enhancements
* Autosuggest feature

= 2.2 - 2017-02-28 =
NOTICE: Requires re-index.

Version 2.2 rethinks the module process to make ElasticPress a more complete query engine solution. Modules are now auto-on and really just features. Why would anyone want to not use amazing functionality that improves speed and relevancy on their website? Features (previously modules) can of course be overridden and disabled. Features that don't have their minimum requirements met, such as a missing plugin dependency, are auto-disabled.

We've bumped the minimum Elasticsearch version to 1.7 (although we strongly recommend 2+). The maximum tested version of Elasticsearch is version 5.2. If you are running Elasticsearch outside this version range, you will see a warning in the dashboard.

### Enhancements
* __(Breaking change)__ Module registration API changed. See `register_module` in `classes/class-ep-modules.php`.
* __(Breaking change)__ Related posts are now in a widget instead of automatically being appending to content.
* __(Breaking change)__ Admin module renamed to Protected Content.
* Admin warning if current Elasticsearch version is not between the min/max supported version. Version 2.2 supports versions 1.3 - 5.1.
* Auto-reindex on versions requiring reindex.
* User friendly admin notifications for ElasticPress not set up, first sync needed, and feature auto activation.
* Protected Content feature applies to all features. This means if Protected Content isn't active, search or WooCommerce integration won't happen in the admin.
* Add support for post_mime_type. Props [Ritesh-patel](https://github.com/Ritesh-patel)

### Bug Fixes
* Back compat with old `ep_search` function.

* Remove `keep alive` setting
* Remove setting to integrate with search (just activate the module instead)
* Back up hosts code removed
* Remove active/inactive state. Rather just check if an index is going on our not.

### Bug fixes

= 1.8 - 2016-01-19 =
NOTICE: Mapping change, requires re-index.

ElasticPress 1.8 adds a bunch of mapping changes for accomplishing more complex WP_Query functions such as filtering by term id and sorting by any Elasticsearch property. Version 1.8 also speeds up post syncing dramatically through non-blocking queries. Full list of enhancements and bug fixes:

### Enhancements:
* Add a filter around the search fuzziness argument. Props [dkotter](https://github.com/dkotter).
* Make post indexing a non-blocking query. Props [cmmarslender](https://github.com/cmmarslender).
* Log queries for debugging. Makes [ElasticPress Debug Bar](https://github.com/10up/debug-bar-elasticpress) plugin possible.

= 1.7 - 2015-12-11 =
NOTICE: Mapping change, requires re-index.

ElasticPress 1.7 restructures meta mapping for posts for much more flexible meta queries. The `post_meta` Elasticsearch post property has been left for backwards compatibility. As of this version, post meta will be stored in the `meta` Elasticsearch property. `meta` is structured as follows:

* `meta.value` (string)
* `meta.raw` (unanalyzed string)
* `meta.long` (unanalyzed number)
* `meta.double` (unanalyzed number)
* `meta.boolean` (unanalyzed number)
* `meta.date` (unanalyzed yyyy-MM-dd date)
* `meta.datetime` (unanalyzed yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss datetime)
* `time` (unanalyzed HH:mm:ss time)

When querying posts, you will get back `meta.value`. However, if you plan to mess with the new post mapping, it's important to understand the intricacies.

The real implications of this is in `meta_query`. You can now effectively search by meta types. See the new section in README.md for details on this.

1.7 also contains the following bugs/enhancements:

* (Bug) Prevent missed post indexing when duplicate post dates. Props [lukaspawlik](https://github.com/lukaspawlik)
* (Bug) Complex meta types are automatically serialized upon storage.
* (Enhancement) Index posts according to post type. Props [sc0ttkclark](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark)
