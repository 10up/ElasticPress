A fast and flexible search and query engine for WordPress.

== Description ==
ElasticPress, a fast and flexible search and query engine for WordPress, enables WordPress to find or “query” relevant content extremely fast through a variety of highly customizable features. WordPress out-of-the-box struggles to analyze content relevancy and can be very slow. ElasticPress supercharges your WordPress website making for happier users and administrators.

Here is a list of the amazing ElasticPress features included in the plugin:

__Search__: Instantly find the content you’re looking for. The first time.

__WooCommerce__: “I want a cotton, woman’s t-shirt, for under $15 that’s in stock.” Faceted product browsing strains servers and increases load times. Your buyers can find the perfect product quickly, and buy it quickly.

__Related Posts__: ElasticPress understands data in real time, so it can instantly deliver engaging and precise related content with no impact on site performance.

__Protected Content__: Optionally index all of your content, including private and unpublished content, to speed up searches and queries in places like the administrative dashboard.

Please refer to [Github](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress) for detailed usage instructions and documentation.

== Installation ==
1. First, you will need to properly [install and configure](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html) Elasticsearch.
2. Activate the plugin in WordPress.
3. In the ElasticPress settings page, input your Elasticsearch host.
4. Enjoy!

== Changelog ==

= 2.2.1 =

Version 2.2.1 is a bug fix release. Here are a listed of issues that have been resolved:

* Fix dashboard syncing delayed start issues.
* If plugins endpoint errors, try root endpoint to get the ES version.
* Make sure orderby is correct for default WooCommerce sorting. Props [ivankristianto](https://github.com/ivankristianto).
* Remove operator=>AND unneed execution code.
* Stop dashboard sync if error occurs in the middle. Props [ivankristianto](https://github.com/ivankristianto).
* Add `EP_INDEX_PREFIX` constant. If set, index names will be prefixed with the constant. Props [allan23](https://github.com/allan23).
* Increase total field limit to 5000 and add filter. Props [ssorathia](https://github.com/ssorathia).
* Prevent EP from auto-activating a feature that was force deactivated
* Prevent massive field Elasticsearch error when indexing large strings
* Increase max result window size to 1000000 and add filter.

= 2.2 (Requires re-index) =

Version 2.2 rethinks the module process to make ElasticPress a more complete query engine solution. Modules are now auto-on and really just features. Why would anyone want to not use amazing functionality that improves speed and relevancy on their website? Features (previously modules) can of course be overriden and disabled. Features that don't have their minimum requirements met, such as a missing plugin dependency, are auto-disabled.

We've bumped the minimum Elasticsearch version to 1.7 (although we strongly recommend 2+). The maximum tested version of Elasticsearch is version 5.2. If you are running Elasticsearch outside this version range, you will see a warning in the dashboard.

### Enhancements

* __(Breaking change)__ Module registration API changed. See `register_module` in `classes/class-ep-modules.php`.
* __(Breaking change)__ Related posts are now in a widget instead of automatically being appending to content.
* __(Breaking change)__ Admin module renamed to Protected Content.
* Admin warning if current Elasticsearch version is not between the min/max supported version. Version 2.2 supports versions 1.3 - 5.1.
* Auto-reindex on versions requiring reindex.
* User friendly admin notifications for ElasticPress not set up, first sync needed, and feature auto activation.
* Protected Content feature applies to all features. This means if Protected Content isn't active, search or WooCommerce integration won't happen in the admin.
* Add support for post_mime_type. Props [Ritesh-patel](https://github.com/Ritesh-patel)

### Bug Fixes

* Back compat with old `ep_search` function.

* Add search scope file. Props [rveitch](https://github.com/rveitch)
* Support WP_Query `post_status`. Props [sc0ttclark](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark)

### Backward compat breaks:

* Move ep_admin_wp_query_integration to search integration only. EP integration by default is available everywhere.
* Remove `keep alive` setting
* Remove setting to integrate with search (just activate the module instead)
* Back up hosts code removed
* Remove active/inactive state. Rather just check if an index is going on our not.

### Bug fixes

= 2.0 =

10up ships ElasticPress 2.0 with __radical search algorithm improvements__ and a __more comprehensive integration of WP_Query__. ElasticPress is now even closer to supporting the complete WP_Query API. This version also improves upon post syncing ensuring that post meta updates are synced to Elasticsearch, adds a number of important hooks, and, of course, fixes some pesky bugs.

### Enhancements
* Radical search algorithm improvements for more relevant results (see [#508](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/pull/508) for details)

= 1.8 (Mapping change, requires reindex) =

ElasticPress 1.8 adds a bunch of mapping changes for accomplishing more complex WP_Query functions such as filtering by term id and sorting by any Elasticsearch property. Version 1.8 also speeds up post syncing dramatically through non-blocking queries. Full list of enhancements and bug fixes:

### Enhancements:

* Add a filter around the search fuzziness argument. Props [dkotter](https://github.com/dkotter).
* Make post indexing a non-blocking query. Props [cmmarslender](https://github.com/cmmarslender).

* Support arbitrary document paths in orderby. Props [sc0ttkclark](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark).

= 1.7 (Mapping change, requires reindex) =

ElasticPress 1.7 restructures meta mapping for posts for much more flexible meta queries. The `post_meta` Elasticsearch post property has been left for backwards compatibility. As of this version, post meta will be stored in the `meta` Elasticsearch property. `meta` is structured as follows:

* `meta.value` (string)
* `meta.raw` (unanalyzed string)
* `meta.long` (unanalyzed number)
* `meta.double` (unanalyzed number)
* `meta.boolean` (unanalyzed number)
* `meta.date` (unanalyzed yyyy-MM-dd date)
* `meta.datetime` (unanalyzed yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss datetime)
* `time` (unanalyzed HH:mm:ss time)

When querying posts, you will get back `meta.value`. However, if you plan to mess with the new post mapping, it's important to understand the intricacies.

The real implications of this is in `meta_query`. You can now effectively search by meta types. See the new section in README.md for details on this.

1.7 also contains the following bugs/enhancements:

* (Bug) Prevent missed post indexing when duplicate post dates. Props [lukaspawlik](https://github.com/lukaspawlik)
* (Bug) Complex meta types are automatically serialized upon storage.
* (Enhancement) Index posts according to post type. Props [sc0ttkclark](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark)
