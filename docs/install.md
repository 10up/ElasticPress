## Install Steps

1. First, you will need to sign up for an [ElasticPress.io account](https://elasticpress.io), or if you prefer, you can [install and configure](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html) Elasticsearch.
2. Install the plugin in WordPress. You can install in the Dashboard, via WP-CLI, or download a [zip via Github](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/archive/master.zip) and upload it using the WordPress plugin uploader.
3. Follow the prompts to add your ElasticPress.io or Elasticsearch server. <img src="https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/raw/develop/images/setup-screenshot.png" width="850">
