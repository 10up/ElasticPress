# ElasticPress Documentation

ElasticPress, a fast and flexible search and query engine for WordPress, enables WordPress to find or “query” relevant content extremely fast through a variety of highly customizable features. WordPress out-of-the-box struggles to analyze content relevancy and can be very slow. ElasticPress supercharges your WordPress website making for happier users and administrators. The plugin even contains features for popular plugins.

**ElasticPress 4.0:** Minimum versions required for ElasticPress 4.0 are:
* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co) 5.2+ **ElasticSearch max version supported: 7.10**
* [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) 5.6+
* [PHP](https://php.net/) 7.0+

**ElasticPress 3.0:** ElasticPress 3.0 contains major changes from 2.x including a rewrite of the feature registration API and PHP 5.4+ features. If you have problems upgrading, please create an issue. The minimum PHP version for ElasticPress 3.6.2 is 5.6.

**Please note:** currently, `trunk` is the stable branch on GitHub.
